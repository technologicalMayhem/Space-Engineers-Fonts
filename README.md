# How to install

Navigate to your Space Engineers installation. In there go into `Content` and then `Fonts`. Make a backup of the `white` and `white_shadow` folder.
Now copy over the font files from this into your Space Engineers font folder. If it asks you to overwrite something just accept it.

There are two fonts in this:
- A higher quality version of the orignal Space Engineers font
- And a more legible font. I am using Liberation Sans for this

Do not that Liberation Sans has slightly different letter sizes and as such text on LCD's might work out a little different.
